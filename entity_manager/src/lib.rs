//! Civil Egregore's entity manager: what stands on the cells -- sheep,
//! people, buildings -- kept beside the bitplanes (`../bitplane_manager`)
//! and ticked with them by the simulation (`../simulation`).
//!
//! An entity is a header -- a random 64-bit ID, a type, the cell it
//! stands on, the tick it next wakes at -- and attributes, typed values
//! added and removed at run time. A superchunk holds its entities in a
//! bucket a chunk, sorted by cell, one a cell at most -- entities never
//! overlap -- and a timer wheel of when each wakes,
//! so a tick costs the entities waking in it and nothing for the rest.
//! An entity is found by its ID and cell: its cell's chunk's bucket,
//! then its ID there -- never a search past its chunk -- which keeps it
//! found however it moves, and a wake or instruction naming one that moved
//! on or died passes it over.
//!
//! Entities change as cells do, in the tick's second phase: a rule
//! queues an instruction in the first, into the outbox slot of the
//! superchunk it lands in, and that superchunk applies it.
//!
//! | file | what is in it |
//! |---|---|
//! | `entity` | an entity: its header and its attributes; and one being changed by its rule |
//! | `bucket` | a chunk's entities, sorted by cell, one a cell, their attributes beside them |
//! | `wheel` | a superchunk's timer wheel |
//! | `store` | a superchunk's entities, and every superchunk's |
//! | `instructions` | changes to entities, an instruction each -- put, move, edit, remove -- queued for a superchunk and applied by it |

// Every item is documented, private ones included; `cargo clippy`
// checks the private ones.
