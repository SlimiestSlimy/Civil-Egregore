//! A superchunk's timer wheel: which entities wake at which tick, so a
//! tick's work is the entities waking then, not every entity.
//!
//! A slot a tick for the next [`WHEEL_TICKS`] ticks, the tick's number
//! modulo that its slot; a wake further off waits in a list beside them,
//! filed into its slot once its tick is in reach, looked over every
//! half of [`WHEEL_TICKS`]. A
//! wake names its entity by ID and cell -- which finds it in its chunk's
//! bucket -- and is only good if the entity still wakes at that tick:
//! one that moved away, died or was woken for another tick is not
//! found, or not due, and is passed over. Nothing is ever taken out of
//! the wheel but the slot just passed.
//!
//! A tick's slot is sorted by cell -- Morton order -- then ID, before
//! the tick runs ([`Wheel::sort`]), so the entities wake in Morton
//! order: their buckets, the cells they read and the writes they queue
//! all go forwards through memory, as the cells' sampling does.
