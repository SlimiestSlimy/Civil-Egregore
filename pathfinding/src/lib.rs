//! TileSim's pathfinding: A* over an **area**, 16x16 cells kept as
//! masks -- a row a `u16`, cell `(x, y)` at bit `x` of row `y` -- which
//! is all it knows of the world. What the cells are, which may be walked
//! on and where the walker wants to go are for whoever calls it; an
//! entity's turn reads an area of the bitplanes around a cell
//! (`instructions::area::read`) and hands it here.
//!
//! | what | what it does |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Wave`] | a search spreading from every goal at once, a cell further each step, the whole area's cells in a few word operations |
//! | [`step_towards`] | a walker's next step to the nearest of many goals, by waves: what an entity asks each time it ticks |
//! | [`nearest`] | the cell of a mask nearest another, in steps, nothing in the way counted |
//! | [`a_star`] | the shortest path between two cells over the cells that may be walked on: its first step and its length |
//!
//! A walker takes a pathfinding step a tick of its own, and keeps no
//! route: each time it asks only where to step next, the world having
//! changed since it last asked. What that costs is waves: all of a
//! search's memory is the cells reached, 32 bytes, beside the 32 of the
//! cells that may be walked on -- one line of cache -- and a wave moves
//! every reached cell's front at once, a row a few shifts and ors.
//!
//! A step is to any of a cell's eight neighbours, each costing one: the
//! steps between two cells with nothing in the way are the greater of
//! their distances across and down ([`steps_apart`]), which is what A*
//! guesses the rest of a path by.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates: a search's working memory is a few arrays on
//! the stack, the size of the area. The design: `docs/pathfinding.md`;
//! function by function: `docs/reference.md`.

// Every item is documented, private ones included; `cargo clippy`
// checks the private ones.
