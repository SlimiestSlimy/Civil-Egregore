//! Grass over dirt: TileSim's first rule. Each tick every cell of grass
//! may spread onto a dirt neighbour, or decay back to dirt the more grass
//! is around it:
//!
//! - **Spreading**: a cell of grass tries to spread with
//!   [`SPREAD_CHANCE`], onto one of its eight neighbours drawn at
//!   random, if that one is dirt.
//! - **Decay**: a cell of grass with `k` of its eight neighbours grass
//!   turns back to dirt with `k / 8` of [`DECAY_CHANCE`]: none with no
//!   grass around, the whole chance with grass all round.
//!
//! One sampling pass serves both, and no sample is wasted: every cell of
//! grass is sampled with the two chances together, and each sample
//! draws one neighbour and which of the two it tries -- spreading, in
//! [`SPREAD_CHANCE`] of the sum, else decay. Decay so happens when the
//! neighbour drawn is grass: `k / 8` of the time, as asked, from one
//! neighbour read rather than eight.
//!
//! The rule runs on each superchunk in a tick's first phase
//! ([`simulation::Simulation::tick`]): its writes are queued as
//! the samples come, in Morton order -- grass spreading over a border
//! into the neighbour's queue -- and applied in the second phase, so
//! every sample reads the world as the tick found it. The two never
//! touch one cell in a tick: decay clears cells that were grass,
//! spreading fills cells that were dirt.
