# What TileSim costs, measured

The measurements in one place: each with the command that gave it, on
the machine they were taken on -- a Ryzen 5 5600, 6 cores and 12
threads, 32 MiB of L3 cache, 15 GiB of memory. The reasons behind each
are in the design it belongs to, named beside it. How things are
measured: `testing_protocol.md`.

## Where memory takes over from the processor

`tilesim world pasture 50000 333 1000 <superchunks> 12` (`world/`): grass
and sheep, 1,000 sheep a superchunk at the start, 50,000 ticks, every
thread. A sample and a wake are the time of the thread doing them.

| superchunks | held, MiB | ticks a second | superchunk-ticks a second | a grass sample, ns | a sheep's wake, ns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 35 | 27,175 | 435,000 | 212 | 490 |
| 64 | 128 | 15,981 | 1,023,000 | 232 | 501 |
| 144 | 285 | 8,654 | 1,246,000 | 280 | 591 |
| 256 | 500 | 4,554 | 1,166,000 | 363 | 729 |
| 400 | 779 | 2,480 | 992,000 | 430 | 821 |
| 576 | 1,119 | 1,686 | 971,000 | 491 | 912 |
| 784 | 1,522 | 1,335 | 1,047,000 | 512 | 945 |
| 1,024 | 1,985 | 1,038 | 1,063,000 | 530 | 991 |

- **Up to 64 superchunks the processor is the limit**: a sample and a
  wake cost what they cost at 16, and 16 is too few to keep 12 threads
  busy -- the work a second still more than doubles to 64.
- **Between 64 and 144 memory takes over**: 128 to 285 MiB held. The
  work a second peaks at 144 and what each sample and wake costs starts
  to climb -- every one is a line of memory not in the caches.
- **By 576 it is all memory**: a sample costs 2.3 times what it did, a
  wake 1.9 times, and both level off: nothing read is in a cache any
  more, and more superchunks cost no more each. The work a second holds
  near a million superchunk-ticks.

So the tick's cost past a hundred superchunks is what it waits for, not
what it computes: what helps there is asking memory ahead (below), and
touching fewer lines a sample and a wake.

## Built with a popcount instruction

`.cargo/config.toml` builds for `x86-64-v2` -- every x86-64 processor
since about 2009, since TileSim is a game, played on many machines --
which has the popcount instruction. It was first built for `native`,
the processor building it; the measurements below were taken then.
Profiled at 400
superchunks, over half the tick is the sampler (`sample_layer`), most
of it walking a count tile's words counting their bits -- which the generic
build did in software, having no popcount instruction to assume.

`tilesim world pasture 20000 333 1000 <superchunks> 12`:

| superchunks | build | ticks a second | a grass sample, ns |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | generic | 18,750 | 227 |
| 64 | native | 20,540 | 172 |
| 400 | generic | 3,144 | 426 |
| 400 | native | 3,444 | 367 |

A tenth more ticks a second at both sizes, and the same world to the
cell: the two builds end 20,000 ticks with the same flock and grass.

On the cloud machine the code is also worked on (a 4-core Xeon at 2.8
GHz), `pasture 20000 333 1000 16 1` and `pasture 3000 333 1000 64 4`,
three rounds each, put generic, `x86-64-v2`, `x86-64-v3` and `native`
within the runs' own spread of each other (11,900 to 13,400 ticks a
second, and 3,200 to 3,600). `x86-64-v2` keeps the popcount the gain
above came from; it is to be measured again on the Ryzen.

The build is now for `x86-64-v3` (AVX2, BMI1 and BMI2: Intel since
Haswell, AMD since Excavator), for the bit instructions wide planes and
what follows them can be written with. On the Ryzen 5 5600,
`tilesim world pasture 20000 333 4000 16`, three rounds a build, twice
over: `x86-64-v2` 31,454 to 33,047 ticks a second, `x86-64-v3` 32,438
to 33,295 -- within each other's spread. Nothing yet uses what v3
brings; nothing is lost by it either.

Tried and not kept: asking memory ahead for the dirt beside each sample
and for the word each write lands in. Nothing gained at 64 or 256
superchunks (348 against 350 ns a sample): the sample's cost is in
finding it, not in what the rule reads after.

## Smaller count tiles

What was left in a sample at scale was the walk itself: up to 64 words
-- eight lines of memory -- to find the chosen cell in its count tile.
The counts are now kept of count tiles of 16 words
(`COUNT_TILE_WORDS`), 32x32 cells:
128 bytes of counts a bucket where there were 32, and a walk of two
lines at most.

`tilesim world pasture <ticks> 333 1000 <superchunks> 12`, both built
native, the same world to the cell:

| superchunks | count tiles of | ticks a second | a grass sample, ns | a sheep's wake, ns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | 64 words | 19,356 and 19,010 | 173 | 557 |
| 64 | 16 words | 20,263 and 19,841 | 179 | 544 |
| 144 | 64 words | 10,802 and 10,808 | | |
| 144 | 16 words | 10,407 and 10,394 | | |
| 400 | 64 words | 3,381 | 369 | 910 |
| 400 | 16 words | 3,671 | 300 | 809 |
| 1,024 | 64 words | 1,263 | 470 | 1,205 |
| 1,024 | 16 words | 1,443 | 350 | 1,068 |

Nothing either way while the world fits the caches -- 4% slower at 144
-- and 9% more ticks a second at 400 superchunks, 14% at 1,024, a
quarter off a sample: it helps where memory is the limit, which is
where a large world is. The far search's tiles of 64x64 cells are now
four count tiles each.

The table at the top was taken before this and before the native
build.

## What a tick is made of

Profiled in the renderer (`perf record -p`, 64 superchunks, flat out) at
the flock's peak, 700,000 sheep: the woken sheep's record 17%, its
attributes 15%, the cells about it 10%, putting it back 12%, sampling
grass 6%, pathfinding under 2%, painting and the window 9%. Woken
entities are now asked of memory ahead: a wake 271 ns where it was 359
(`simulation/docs/simulation.md`, "Woken entities are asked of memory
ahead").

## The cells about a woken sheep, asked for ahead

`Turn::woken_reading(layers)`: as woken entities are asked of
memory ahead, so are the cells about them, of the layers the rule says
it reads -- the sheep's grass and the four walls.

| world | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| generated, 64 superchunks, walls (`tilesim world run <dir> 30000`) | 13,236 ticks a second | 13,964 |
| mock, 400 superchunks, no walls (`tilesim world pasture 20000 333 4000 400 12`) | a wake 695 ns, 2,381 ticks a second | 645 ns, 2,375 |
| mock, 64 superchunks, no walls | a wake 439 ns, 15,131 ticks a second | 477 ns, 14,566 |

Kept for the world that is played: 5% more ticks a second with walls
to read. On the mock, which has no walls, asking for the wall layers,
four then, that are not there is pure cost at 64 superchunks. The
walls are two layers now (`terrain/docs/terrain.md`).

## Terrain

A generated 64-superchunk world now runs 13,964 ticks a second, with
the native build, the smaller count tiles and the cells asked for ahead; the
figures below were taken before those.


`tilesim world new <dir> Perf 1 64`, `tilesim world run <dir> 50000`: a generated
world, walls read by every hungry sheep, 10,399 ticks a second; the
mock world of the same size without them
(`tilesim world pasture 50000 333 4000 64 12`), 11,649. Generating a
superchunk's heights and walls: 40 ms on one thread.

## Saves

64 superchunks, 256,000 sheep: 96 MiB written at tick 0, 115 MiB at
tick 50,000 with 571,500 -- 1 MiB a superchunk of it heights, raw.

## Inlining is fragile: hot lookups are marked

Whether the compiler inlines a small function into its caller in
another crate is its own call, and moves with changes nowhere near it.
Drawing a random number through `utilities::hash::mix`, not the same
four lines written out, made the entity bucket's lookups
(`Bucket::find`, `get`) stop being inlined into the sheep's rule: the
tick's instructions (`pasture 300 333 4000 4 1`, the ticks alone) went
from 67.88 million to 69.61, the world's every result unchanged. The
lookups on the hot path are marked `#[inline]` now -- `Bucket::get`,
`index_of`, `find`, `entity`, `SuperchunkEntities::get`,
`Rng::draw` -- and the tick takes 67.78 million. A change that moves
the count with no change of work is looked for there first.

## Under full load: every superchunk hot

Measured in the renderer, every superchunk shown forced hot and grass
growing everywhere (`cargo run --release -p renderer -- <superchunks>
1000 0 0 1`), flat out on 12 threads, built for `x86-64-v2`; the rates
are from the census, over the lines whose pace is 0. Each superchunk
starts with 1,000 sheep, and the flock grows as the run goes.

64 superchunks (8 x 8), 560 MiB resident:

| tick | sheep | ticks a second |
|---|---|---|
| 25,000 | 98,884 | 14,006 |
| 50,000 | 152,000 | 11,704 |
| 100,000 | 318,000 | 9,513 |
| 150,000 | 584,000 | 5,837 |
| 200,000 | 782,000 | 3,078 |
| 225,000 | 769,483 | 2,370 |

1,024 superchunks (32 x 32), 2,585 MiB resident, 18 seconds to make:
714 ticks a second at tick 1,000 (999,000 sheep), 926 to 943 from tick
9,000 to 13,000, 724 at tick 49,000 (2.4 million sheep). This run was
before the census kept the pace, so it is not known to be flat out
throughout.

65,536 superchunks (256 x 256) cannot be held hot: 2.5 MiB a
superchunk is some 160 GiB.

## Superchunks claimed, not dealt out

A tick used to deal the superchunks out, a fixed contiguous run a
thread; the threads with light runs then waited for the heaviest, and
12 threads were 41% busy flat out. Now each thread claims the next
superchunk not yet claimed. Measured in the renderer, 256 superchunks
shown (324 hot with their halos' rim), 8,000 sheep on each at the
start, flat out (`cargo run --release -p renderer -- 256 8000 0`):

| ticks | sheep | dealt out | claimed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4,000 to 32,000 | 2.1 to 3.4 million | 966 a second | 1,338 a second |
| 32,000 to 44,000 | 3.4 to 3.8 million | 527 a second | 564 a second |

Workers watching for the next job a moment before parking, instead of
parking at once, was tried on the same run and gained nothing: not kept.
