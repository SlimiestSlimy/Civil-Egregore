# TileSim

What TileSim is, and every decision about it made so far, written down
so that none is forgotten. What is built is marked as built; the rest is
the plan. Every decision here is weighed against the
[design statements](design_statements.md).

## The game

A 2D procedural simulation game, parallel wherever it can be. The player
starts with a couple of basic tents, a few people and a campfire, and
grows a civilization from there, through seasons and weather, managing
resources and choosing what the humans do, build, work on and study.
The player never controls a human directly, only what gets done and
where: the player is a hive-mind parasite hiding in every human,
unnoticed, nudging their decisions towards survival and progress.

## The world

### Cells, chunks and superchunks

| grain | size | what it is for |
|---|---|---|
| cell | one tile of the world | the unit everything is placed on |
| chunk | 256x256 cells | the unit the world's layers are held in |
| superchunk | 4x4 chunks, 1024x1024 cells | the grain of disk input and output, of terrain generation, of the height map and of hot bitmaps |

A superchunk is read and written whole, and terrain is generated a
superchunk at a time.

Coordinates are non-negative integers, counted from the world's top
left, and resolve by cascade: a superchunk (under 2^22 each way), then
a chunk in it (0 to 3), then a cell in that chunk (0 to 255). The world
starts roughly in the middle of both axes, so there is room in every
direction.

A cell's coordinates are a `u32` each, and their Morton index, a `u64`,
locates it alone: from the lowest bit, 16 for the cell in its chunk, 4
for the chunk in its superchunk, 44 for the superchunk in the world.
Every cell, chunk and superchunk has a Morton index, and they nest:
a chunk's is its cells' without the low 16 bits, a superchunk's without
the low 20.

The Morton index is a cell's identity everywhere it is cheaper
(`CellIndex`): writes are anchored at one, sampling hands them out, and
reads take them. Its superchunk, chunk and bit are bit fields -- shifts
and masks, no coordinates -- and a neighbour is a step on the index
itself, each coordinate's bits added apart (`CellIndex::offset`).
Cartesian coordinates (`CellCartesian`) are kept where they are the
cheaper: a rectangle's or a disc's geometry, and drawing.

An aligned 8x8 square of cells is one word of a bitmap: a **tile**.
Cells near one another are read as tiles, not one by one: a window of
up to 8x8 cells at any cell is cut from the one to four tiles it
overlaps -- each word turned row by row in three delta swaps, then
shifted and masked (`bitmap::tile`, `Reader::window`) -- so a rule
reads a neighbourhood as a mask and decides on it in boolean steps,
with no array of cells and no loop over them.

Superchunks are 4x4 chunks because a hot superchunk bitmap holds a
bucket for every chunk of its superchunk, even for a single set cell:
at 16x16 chunks that is 2 MiB, at 4x4 it is 128 KiB, so 8 GiB holds
65,536 of them -- far more independent hot bitmaps. Buckets stay fixed
in size, found in O(1) by Morton index from a small array.

### Layers

A chunk's data is its **layers**: pairs of a type and an encoded
bitmap. The type is a `u64` naming what the bitmap represents, anything
from specific things (a kind of tree, say) to properties (wet,
burning). The bitmap marks the cells where it holds, Tessera-encoded in
64-bit words, in memory and on disk alike. A chunk holds at most one
layer per type, and a type with no cell set has no layer.

A Tessera stream ends itself: its range coder ends with bits that
decode the same whatever follows them, at about 0.6 bits a bitmap more
than ending on implied zeros. So no bitmap's length is kept: bitmaps
lie one after another, each read from its first word.

Heights are one `u8` a cell, raw for now, in one height map a
superchunk. They will need compressing too.

Most layers will probably be sparse. Tessera, the encoding the layers
are held in, is not optimized further for that until the game needs it.

### Chunk storage: the cold pool and the writeback ring

Chunk storage (`chunk_storage/`) is two parts in memory:

1. **The cold pool**: superchunk images, each one run of words, laid
   out as on disk (below). When the bitplane manager asks for a
   bitmap, it is decoded from here into the bitmap planes.
2. **The writeback ring**: a ring buffer of changed bitmaps, encoded,
   each tagged with its chunk's Morton index and its type; one of no
   words says the layer is gone. Writing back a dirty bucket appends to
   the ring; it never touches the cold pool. A superchunk going cold
   fills the ring with its changed bitmaps, tagged -- encoded off the
   tick -- and is not flushed then: the ring flushes it when it needs
   the room, the image rewritten off the tick, the bitmaps held until
   it is in.

The ring is cold writeback only: it is never read to make a bitmap
hot. A bitmap with an entry in the ring is still in the bitplanes: an
evicted bitmap's bucket stays allocated until its superchunk is
flushed, and one made hot again before then is the bucket as it was --
a superchunk gone cold as a whole likewise, lingering.

The ring is a sponge for writes into the cold pool. A superchunk is
sequential even in memory, so changing one bitmap in place would mean
resizing it and moving everything after it. Instead the ring absorbs
writes, and a superchunk is rewritten once, its image merged with its
ring entries into a new image. The ring frees from its tail: when an
entry does not fit, the superchunk whose entry is at the tail is
flushed -- rewritten, which frees every entry of it -- until it fits;
the tail then skips entries already freed. A later entry for the same
bitmap replaces an earlier one. Entries never wrap round the ring's
end: one that does not fit before it starts again at the start. The
ring grows only when empty and still too small for an entry. Each
flush is told to the bitplane manager, which only then drops the
evicted buckets of that superchunk.

A superchunk image, in the cold pool and on disk alike, every part starting
on a word:

1. **The chunk table**: the offset of each of its 16 chunks, in Morton
   order.
2. **The height map**: one for the whole superchunk, 1024x1024
   heights, raw for now (1 MiB), 8 a word, in Morton order, so each
   chunk's heights are one 64 KiB run.
3. **Its chunks, in Morton order**, each grouping its own data:
   1. **its bitmap table**: its entry count, then one entry a bitmap,
      sorted by type, each a type and the bitmap's offset from the
      chunk's start;
   2. **its bitmaps**, encoded, each starting on a word, in no
      particular order: the table's offsets find them.

On disk a superchunk's image is one file, named by its Morton index,
its words written sequentially as laid out in memory ("Saves", below).

### From the disk to the cells

1. A superchunk image is read from disk into the cold pool as it is,
   its layers still encoded.
2. Cells are read and changed in the **bitmap arena**
   (`bitplane_manager/`): its buckets hold the hot bitmaps, raw, one
   layer of one chunk each, decoded from the cold pool only when needed. The
   arena is the only place with a cell API.
3. The arena is made of allocations, each one layer type over one
   superchunk: an array of buckets, one for each of its chunks with a
   cell set, 16 at the most, in the chunks' Morton order. A chunk with
   none has no bucket and reads clear; a chunk's bucket is found in
   O(1) by how many chunks before it have one. (Until measured, an
   allocation held all 16 buckets, whole, and none ever moved: see
   `performance.md`, "A bucket only for a chunk with cells".)
4. A small directory says which allocation holds which type over which
   superchunk: the superchunks in Morton order, each with its types
   sorted -- the one thing ever sorted, and it holds no bitmaps. The
   last superchunk looked up is remembered, so runs of lookups in
   one superchunk search only its few types. The allocations
   lie wherever they were made; each one is a large run of memory in
   Morton order.
5. The arena grows an allocation at a time. A bucket changed since it
   was decoded is dirty; writing back encodes it into the ring, no words
   if no cell is left set. A dirty bucket must be written back before
   it is evicted. An allocation with no bucket hot or waiting in the
   ring leaves the directory, its buckets with it.
6. Every bucket counts its set cells, kept in step with every change,
   and every allocation the set cells of its hot buckets together (a
   `u32`, up to 2^20): the weights sampling picks by. A bitmap with any
   cell set has 1 to 65,536 of them, so its count is a `u16` holding
   the count less one, beside a bit a chunk saying whether any cell is
   set -- a hot bucket may be empty, though a stored layer never is.

The mock superchunk (`chunk_storage::mock`) is the first world to try
this on: two layer types, dirt and grass, dirt everywhere but a few
cells of grass scattered at random.

### The tick budget

The simulation is to run at 1 kHz -- a tick every millisecond -- with
1,000 to 10,000 updates a tick. Against that budget, what the world
structures cost decides where each operation may run:

- **Nothing on the tick path decodes or encodes.** Decoding a layer and
  encoding one back each cost a large share of a tick or more. They run
  between ticks or on other threads, and bitmaps are made hot ahead of
  the ticks that touch them.
- **Updates are applied bucket by bucket.** A lookup by cell pays
  for the coordinate split, the directory search and the chunk's index
  every time, and random updates across the arena miss the cache on
  nearly every one. Updates grouped by bucket, in the arena's order --
  which the plan's scheduling by superchunk, chunk and cell already
  groups them by -- pay one lookup a bucket and touch memory in order.
- **For later:** ordering the computations themselves in Morton order,
  as the data is, so each tick walks memory forwards.

`make_hot_layers` turns a chunk's layers hot filtered by type: only the
types asked for are decoded, and the chunk's other layers stay encoded.

### Built so far

The in-memory structures and their API, in two projects: chunks as
stored (`chunk_storage/`) and the hot bitplanes
(`bitplane_manager/`): the coordinates and
Morton indices between the world, a superchunk, a chunk and a cell; the
height map; the layer codec; the superchunk image; the cold pool and
the writeback ring; the bitmap arena. Nothing is read from or written
to disk yet, though an image's words are what a file will hold: disk
access comes once these are right, since it brings concerns of its own.

Planned: loading an aligned power-of-two square of chunks for a set of
layer types at once. Such a square is one run of Morton indices in its
superchunk, so its buckets are one run of each type's allocation.

Still open: where heights are read and changed while hot (an image
only hands them over whole, and is never changed in place), when
buckets are evicted and superchunks flushed, and reading and writing
superchunks on disk.

## Decided, not built yet

### Memory

- A custom allocator is to serve two projects only: chunk storage
  (`chunk_storage/`, the cold area) and the bitplane manager
  (`bitplane_manager/`, the hot bitmap area). There is none now: its
  first form, a block pool of equal-size blocks, was removed once the
  arena's buckets became a variable array a superchunk and nothing
  used it. Chunk storage's images and ring, and the arena's buckets,
  are plain allocations until the area allocator below exists.
- A custom allocator per area, not one global allocator: the system is
  asked for large blocks, 256 MiB at a time, tracked in a list; inside
  them, allocations are runs of 256-byte units, the allocated intervals
  kept in a sorted list. A few lines of `unsafe` hand out the memory;
  an allocation is an owning handle that frees itself when dropped.
  Nothing is ever resized in place by moving it.
- **The cold area** is chunk storage's cold pool and writeback ring.
  It may move data: a superchunk rewritten is written into new space,
  never resized in place.
- **The hot bitmap area** is cut into allocations a superchunk and a
  layer type each, changed apart: a bucket moves only inside its own.

### The speed of light

No action reaches farther than 1024 cells a tick -- a superchunk's side
-- counting the far edge of what it writes, not just its anchor. So
whatever a cell does in a tick lands in its own superchunk or one of
the eight around it (in chunks: the 9x9 around its own), never farther.
What follows:

- A border of hot superchunks one deep around every active one is
  enough for no read or write to fall on a cold bitmap.
- Superchunks three apart each way never touch the same superchunk in
  a tick: updated in nine colours (x mod 3, y mod 3), one colour at a
  time, they need no synchronization -- two apart is not enough, as S
  and S + 2 both reach S + 1. Or each superchunk's owner applies every
  write that lands in it, the others handing theirs over, which needs
  no colours, and the handing over reaches the eight neighbours only.
- Not checked yet: rules keeping their writes within the reach.

### The tick

Two steps a tick:

1. **Compute.** Small functions, one per action, sample by Monte Carlo
   over the action's main bit plane, where its cells are set; an action
   may also read other planes, and nearby entities by type. Every action
   has one of a fixed set of maximum ranges, from neighbouring cells up
   to the game's speed of light. Actions are sorted by maximum range
   first, then sampled in Morton order -- one dimension -- so similar
   actions read and write the same areas at the same time, and execution
   stays highly (never totally) sequential in memory. Their writes are
   collected as intents.
2. **Apply.** The bitmap manipulation layer batches the tick's writes:
   operations -- an area and what to do to it: set, unset, flip, and
   others -- go into queues by layer type, are sorted into Morton order
   of their coordinates, and are applied in that order.

   Built: the tick runs superchunk by superchunk, in two phases, on as
   many threads as asked (`Simulation::tick`, in `simulation/`). In the first, each
   superchunk runs the rules on itself -- samples its own cells, reads
   any cell, queues writes -- and nothing changes, so every read sees
   the world as the tick found it and the threads share the arena
   read-only. Each superchunk has an outbox of nine queues: one for
   itself, one for each of its eight neighbours, a write going to every
   superchunk it lands in (a shape across a border to each); a write
   farther than the neighbours is past the speed of light, and refused.
   In the second phase each superchunk applies the writes queued for it
   -- its own and its eight neighbours', in a fixed order -- to its own
   bitmaps only, so the threads change disjoint superchunks. Each
   superchunk owns its blocks, and draws its random numbers from the
   tick's seed and its Morton index: a tick comes out the same on any
   number of threads. Threads hold contiguous runs of the directory, so
   each works through superchunks in Morton order.

   Write queues, one a layer type.
   A write is fixed in size, 16 bytes -- the layer type is its queue's:
   an anchor cell, an operation -- set, unset, flip, or a number put in
   a wide plane's cell -- and a shape --
   the cell, a rectangle from it of up to 255 cells a side, or a disc
   around it of a radius up to 255. Writes are queued, change nothing
   until applied, and apply queue by queue, each in the order queued:
   where writes to one bitplane overlap, the latest wins. Cells of
   bitmaps not hot are left unwritten, and counted. Writes are not
   sorted: sampling emits them in Morton order already. Not yet:
   writing a word at a time rather than a cell.

   Measured (a `write_order` example, since removed -- git keeps it --
   once Morton order was settled as sampling's: 100,000 random
   writes a run, nine in ten a single cell, 50 runs, dirt and grass hot
   everywhere), in nanoseconds a write, mean:

   | superchunks | bitmaps' size | as drawn | Morton order | the sort |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | 256 KiB | 76 | 74 | 44 |
   | 16 | 4 MiB | 141 | 127 | 53 |
   | 64 | 16 MiB | 189 | 157 | 50 |

   Ordering pays more the more memory the writes spread over, but not
   yet as much as sorting random writes costs: apply spends most of a
   write on finding its bucket, which it does afresh for every write.

Sampling picks, by weight of set cells, a superchunk, then a chunk in
it, then a cell, found by scanning the chunk's words for set bits. The
counts it weighs by are built: per bitmap and per superchunk bitplane,
in the bitplane manager.

### Sampling (built)

`simulation::sample` chooses every hot set cell of a layer type with
one probability, each independently, and hands the chosen cells out in
Morton order: superchunk by superchunk, chunk by chunk, cell by cell.
So the writes computed from them are queued in Morton order already,
and never sorted.

No sample is wasted: no cell is tossed a coin, and no draw lands on a
clear cell to be thrown away. The set cells are ranked in Morton order,
and the gap from one chosen rank to the next is drawn from the
geometric law -- `floor(ln(u) / ln(1 - p))`, `u` uniform in `(0, 1]` --
which chooses each set cell with probability `p`, independently. The
counts then find each chosen rank without a linear scan: a superchunk
bitplane is passed over whole by its count, a chunk by its count, a
count tile of 16 words -- 32x32 cells -- by its count, a word by its bits'
count, and only the word holding a chosen cell is searched. A chunk is so sampled in proportion to its set cells against
the rest of its superchunk.

The first rule built on it is grass (`mc_rules/src/grass.rs`). Each tick a
cell of grass tries to spread with a chance of 0.001%, onto one of its
eight neighbours drawn at random, if that one is dirt; and turns back
to dirt with `k / 8` of 0.0005%, `k` its grass neighbours -- none alone,
the whole 0.0005% with grass all round. One sampling pass serves both, at
0.0015%: each sample draws one neighbour, and spreads (two thirds of the
time) or decays (a third) if that neighbour lets it, so decay comes
at `k / 8` of its chance from one neighbour read, not eight. Every
sample reads the world as the tick found it: the writes are applied at
the tick's end. Spreading at `0.001% x (dirt share)` and decay at
`0.0005% x (grass share)` balance, roughly, at two thirds of the cells
grass. (Decay was 0.002%, and the balance a third: grazed, the grass
then thinned year on year and the flock starved with it. The chances were a hundred times these until the world was
first seen on a screen, where grass at 0.3% a tick boils; every
measurement below was taken at 0.3%.)

What a write costs -- sampling, computing, applying -- and how many
superchunks of grass a core keeps at the game's pace are what
`tilesim server throughput` reports, at any number of superchunks and
threads; a write is one cell set or cleared, a spread or a decay two.
The tick is the same on any number of threads, and faster on more.

`tilesim server throughput` also reports the memory held: the process's
peak and its average over the ticks (from `/proc/self/status`), and
what the arena's blocks and storage's images take. Most of what is
held is the stored images, and most of those the raw height maps.

Threads kept between ticks (the dispatcher, `utilities::dispatcher`), against
started afresh each phase, ticks a second:

| superchunks | threads | started each phase | kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 2 | 593 | 683 |
| 16 | 4 | 947 | 1,095 |
| 64 | 2 | 171 | 185 |
| 64 | 4 | 307 | 303 |

Started
afresh each phase, the threads cost a tick of 16 superchunks -- about
2 ms -- a share of its time; kept, they no longer do.

Sampling now costs the most: a logarithm a
sample, the words' bits counted on the way, and the chosen word's bits
cleared one by one to the one asked. Computing and applying find a
cell's bucket through the directory -- superchunks by Morton index,
then their types -- and remember the last superchunk and type found,
so Morton-ordered work rarely searches at all. Before that, a
directory sorted by type then superchunk and searched afresh for every
cell made computing and applying cost 2.5 to 3 times as much at 16 and
64 superchunks.

Every thread works sequentially within a superchunk; across superchunks
the perimeter to area ratio keeps synchronization rare. How overlapping
updates between superchunks are handled -- a before and after copy
would double the memory -- is decided once a system can have them.

Monte Carlo sampling suits a GPU too.

The height map is ignored for now.

### Entities (built, first form)

An entity is a capability unit, not necessarily alive. The first form
is built in the entity manager (`entity_manager/src/`), with sheep on
it (`entity_rules/src/sheep.rs`):

- **A record**: a header -- a random 64-bit ID, a type, the cell it
  stands on, the tick it next wakes at -- and attributes, typed values
  added and removed at run time (a sheep falls pregnant, a lamb grows
  up). Types, of entities and attributes alike, are `u64`s from the one
  namespace every type in TileSim is drawn from, layers' included.
- **A bucket a chunk**: a superchunk holds its entities in a bucket for
  each of its 16 chunks -- a chunk may hold many single-cell entities --
  the headers sorted by cell, in Morton order, then by ID, the
  attributes in one list beside them, a run an entity. The cells' places
  in the chunk, 16 bits each, are kept alone in a list beside the
  headers, and that is what is searched: two bytes an entity, a few
  lines a search, small enough to stay in the caches. An entity
  stepping inside its chunk moves along the lists, past those between
  the two cells. A run whose length changes is rewritten at the list's
  end, the old one left as garbage, swept out once there is as much
  garbage as attributes in use.
- **Morton order, as the bitplanes**: buckets were never to be sorted
  by ID. Entities wake in Morton order of the cell they stand on --
  their origin -- and emit their changes in that order, so the second
  phase gets them nearly in the order the buckets are held in, not
  perfectly but enough not to stall on memory: the design of sampling,
  which draws cells at random and hands them out in Morton order.
- **Reach and size**: an entity affects nothing farther than 1024 cells
  away, the speed of light, and is at most 256x256 cells, whatever its
  shape or how many cells it covers. Neither is checked yet.
- **IDs, not slots**: an entity is found by its cell and its ID -- its
  cell's chunk's bucket, its cell's place searched for, then its ID
  among those on the cell -- never further than its chunk. A slot would go stale whenever the entity
  crossed a chunk border, moved superchunk or was swept, and nothing
  holds a pointer back to fix it; an ID survives all of it, and a wake
  or change naming an entity no longer on its cell -- moved on, or dead
  -- is just not found, and passed over: of two changes to one entity
  in a tick, the first to move it wins. IDs are drawn from the superchunk's random numbers:
  a clash inside a chunk is a chance of one in 2^64 a pair. Over the
  whole world and its history, a clash somewhere becomes likely past
  billions of entities -- no matter for the tick, but to be revisited
  when entities remember each other by ID (a birth superchunk and its
  own count, say).
- **A timer wheel a superchunk**: most entities wait most of the time
  -- a person walking steps a cell every 128 ticks or so -- so a tick
  costs the entities waking in it, and nothing for the rest. The wheel
  has a slot a tick for the next 1024; further wakes wait in a list,
  filed every half turn once in reach. A wake is only good if the
  entity still wakes at that tick.
- **In the two phases**: in the first, the entities waking in a
  superchunk run the rule beside its cells, reading the world as the
  tick found it, and queue changes -- an entity put (made, changed or
  moved in) or removed -- into the outbox slot of the superchunk each
  lands in, as writes are. In the second, each superchunk carries out
  the changes queued for it. An entity moving to a neighbour goes as a
  whole copy, made in the first phase, so the second never reads
  another superchunk's entities while it changes them. The speed of
  light holds for entities as for cells.
- **The same API as the bitplanes**: outside a tick, changes to
  entities are queued and applied, as writes to cells are -- queuing is
  the only way to change one; in a tick, a turn reads entities anywhere
  held, by ID or by chunk, as the tick found them, as it reads cells.
- **Lost entities**: put in a superchunk whose bitplanes are not held,
  an entity is lost, and counted. Keeping a superchunk's entities in
  chunk storage when it goes cold is work to come, as are reading other
  entities near a cell, collisions, entities spanning many cells, and
  load balancing. (Reading the entities on a chunk is there; nothing
narrows it to the cells near one yet.)

The three packed-memory arrays discussed before (hot, cold and bulk,
each one contiguous Morton-sorted region) were set aside for this: a
superchunk owning its own storage keeps loading, evicting and saving a
superchunk local, with no boundaries to shift between threads.

What a sheep's wake, a grass sample and an applied change each cost is
what `tilesim server pasture` reports. At first a wake cost several times
a sample.

Why, counted (callgrind, one superchunk, 300 ticks): about 1,550
instructions a wake, nearly all reading the world -- five cell reads at
~113 each, four steps to a neighbour at ~79 each (the distance spread
out even for one cell), write queues missing their one-type cache as
grass and dirt alternate -- the sheep's own decisions ~200. Then cut:
a step of one cell spreads nothing, the neighbourhood is read at once
(inside a chunk, one lookup and eight bits of one bucket), lookups and
write queues remember 16 types, and a tick's wakes run in Morton order.
A wake was then ~1,020 instructions, of which the neighbourhood ~250.
(Those 16-entry caches, hashed, were later measured to cost more than
they saved, once the window reads came: without them a tick is 6.5%
fewer instructions. A lookup remembers the last superchunk alone, and
a write finds its queue by a search of the few.)

The neighbourhood is since a window: the sheep's 3x3, its own cell in
the middle, read as one mask -- one bucket lookup and one to four
words -- so what it eats and where it walks come from one read, and a
neighbour is drawn from the mask's bits.

The time hardly moved -- 806 ns -- because it is memory, not work: the
same wake costs 196 ns over one superchunk, 367 over four and 806 over
sixteen, the instructions the same, the working set (bitmaps, buckets,
wheels, ~0.7 MiB a superchunk) leaving the caches. Morton order helps
little while wakes are sparse -- some 66 a superchunk a tick, 16,000
cells apart -- and each wake's binary search in its bucket, sorted by
ID, touches lines nothing else does.

The figures above are from a virtual machine; those below from a
machine of its own (a Ryzen 5 5600: 6 cores, 12 threads), measured with
the processor's counters (`perf`), not instruction counts alone.

Where a pasture's time goes (`perf record`, 64 superchunks, one
thread, buckets still sorted by ID), by share of each event:

| | cycles | loads filled from memory |
|---|---|---|
| sampling (`sample_layer`) | 26% | 2% |
| finding an entity by ID (`get`, `put`: the binary search) | 13% | 33% |
| reading a cell (`Lookup::holds`) | 10% | 9% |
| setting a cell (`put_cell`) | 7% | 15% |

The binary search by ID was a third of every load that went to memory
-- as said above, now counted. Sampling is work, not memory: a third
of the instructions and of the mispredicted branches, about 6.5 of
those a sample. The tile windows changed no time here: a wake stayed
at 149, 194 and 384 ns over 1, 16 and 64 superchunks.

Buckets sorted by cell and searched by their places, a sheep's wake,
nanoseconds, one thread (`tilesim server pasture 3000 333 4000`):

| superchunks | sorted by ID | sorted by cell |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 149 | 127 |
| 4 | 167 | 139 |
| 16 | 193 | 170 |
| 64 | 362 | 261 |

Finding an entity fell from 13% of the cycles to 8% at 64 superchunks,
the flock and the grass the same to the sheep. The wake still doubles
from 1 to 64 superchunks -- 234 MiB held against 32 MiB of cache -- and
what now goes to memory most is setting cells (17% of those loads),
then the entities' headers and attributes themselves (24%), which a
search no longer reads but a wake must.

### Grass slowed, and the sheep with it

Seen on a screen, grass at 0.3% a tick boiled, so it was slowed a
hundredfold -- and the sheep, eating a cell every wake, stripped it and
died out: grass now regrows about one cell a tick a superchunk, far
less than a flock eats, and spreads only to its neighbours, so a
grazed-out patch stays bare, and a sheep in one starves before it
walks out. The sheep since:

- **Graze when hungry**: a meal every 96 wakes, not every wake;
  starving 288 wakes after the last. (Since held as ticks: below.)
- **Breed on lush pasture only**: on a meal taken where at least 4 of
  the 9 cells it stands amid are grass, at one in 6. Thin grass stops
  a flock growing before it is stripped: the brake a flock lacked.
- **Die of old age**, at one wake in 2,400, so the flock turns over
  without waiting to starve.
- **Walk to grass**: hungry, with none beside it, a sheep steps along
  the shortest path to the nearest grass in the 16x16 cells about it.

Measured, headless, 4 superchunks from 1,000 sheep each: with long
lives and slow breeding (one in 25, 9,600 wakes) the flock grows
steadily and never swings; with these numbers, before the paths, it
rose from 4,000 to 21,600 in 700,000 ticks, fell to 900 by 2.6
million, and held there as the grass came back.

### Entities never overlap (built)

A cell holds one entity, ever. It is kept where entities are held, not
by the rules: a chunk's bucket has one record a cell.

- **Checked as the change is carried out.** The superchunk owning the
  cell looks as it carries a change out, in the second phase: a mover
  whose cell is taken -- by an entity standing there, or one that got
  there first this tick -- stays where it stood, changed all the same,
  and a new entity is not put. The look is the search that finds where
  the record goes, and costs nothing more.
- **A rule need not look first.** Few cells have an entity, so a step
  taken blind is seldom turned back, and looking every step costs more
  than the steps lost. A rule looks when it matters that the cell be
  had: a lamb is not born where it cannot stand, and a path goes round
  the entities in the way.
- **Staying is always safe**: a mover's own cell is its own until it
  has moved, so none can have taken it.
- **No bitplane of the cells entities stand on.** One was kept, a cell
  set and cleared with every step, and read as any bitplane: it cost a
  fifth of the ticks a second on 12 threads -- a second cell of memory
  written, far from the first, for every step -- and was taken out.
  Where entities stand is asked of the entities (`occupied`): a bucket
  is sorted by cell, and an aligned 8x8 tile is a run of cells in
  Morton order, so the entities on it are a run of the bucket's
  places, found by one search. It costs only when asked.
- **A bucket is searched by block**: where each block of 64x64 cells'
  places start is kept, 16 a chunk, so a search is among one block's
  places -- a few steps, on one or two lines of memory -- not all the
  chunk's.
- **Crossing a superchunk border.** Two superchunks are changed apart,
  so the one left cannot know whether the one entered took the entity.
  The entity is put there as new, and changed here too as if its cell
  there were taken; once every superchunk has applied its
  instructions, each one that arrived is removed from the cell it
  left -- a short pass over the tick's arrivals alone. Its cell here
  is never left for one it could not have, and no rule ever sees an
  entity twice: between ticks it stands on one cell. (It used to stay
  here asleep a tick, until the next tick's first phase found whether
  it had arrived -- so for that tick it could be seen, counted and
  acted on in both.) One walking to the edge of the superchunks held
  stays there.
- **Sheep**: a lamb is born on a cell seen free beside its mother, who
  waits for one.

Measured against the build before it (`tilesim server pasture`, 4,000
sheep a superchunk): 16 superchunks on one thread, 20,000 ticks, 4.07
seconds against 4.08, 3% more instructions; 64 superchunks on 12
threads, about 5,300 ticks a second both, within what one run differs
from the next. What was tried on the way, each measured: the bitplane
written through the write queues' own path, 36% slower on one thread;
written a bit at a time, and read with the grass in one window, 10%
slower on one thread and 20% on 12.

### A sheep sleeps until it needs something

A satisfied sheep used to wake every 64 ticks to wander, and count its
hunger, its pregnancy and its youth a wake at a time: nearly every wake
was a sheep with nothing to do. Now what a sheep has coming is held as
ticks -- when it is next hungry, when its lamb is due, when it is grown
-- and, satisfied, it stays where it stands and wakes at the first of
them. Only a hungry sheep walks, a step every 64 ticks or so, to grass.
Old age comes by the tick slept, not the wake. This is what the timer
wheel was for: a tick costs the entities with something to do.

Measured (`tilesim server pasture 20000 333 4000 64`, 12 threads): 88
wakes a tick where there were about 3,600, and 17,400 ticks a second
against 5,300.

### Sheep leave thin pasture, and breed by the area about them

Resting where it ate, a sheep never left where it was born: lambs stayed
beside their mothers, each flock grazed its own patch bare, and births
stopped though a third of the world was green -- watched in the renderer,
64 superchunks fell from 256,000 sheep to 8,500 over 1.75 million ticks
and went on falling. Breeding more readily did not mend it: at one meal
in three the flock outgrew the grass, stripped it and died out, the
nine cells a sheep stood amid telling it nothing of the pasture.

Since, two things. Whether pasture is lush is asked of the 16x16 cells
about the sheep -- a quarter of them grass -- read at a meal, once in
6,912 ticks: grass left alone covers two thirds of the dirt and grows
fastest covering a third, so the flock stops growing while the grass
still gains on it. And a sheep that eats where it is not lush leaves:
hungry again, it walks one way for 3,456 ticks -- 48 steps or so --
eating nothing, before it looks for grass (`ROAMING`, an attribute:
the tick it roams until and the way, set once, so a step on the way
changes nothing but its cell).

Measured, headless, 4 superchunks from 4,000 sheep each, 2 million
ticks: the flock rises to 43,800, falls to 2,900, and comes round to
about 10,000 with the grass near a fifth of the cells, the swings
smaller each time. Without the roaming the same run ends at 232 sheep
and falling; at one in three and no roaming, at none.

### An instruction for each thing done to an entity

The sheep did everything by one instruction -- the whole entity put
again, attributes and all, each wake -- and held in its own file what
every entity will want: the nine cells beside it as bits, a free one
for a lamb, the path to grass round the others. All of it is now
shared (`instructions/docs/instructions.md`): the simulation's four
instructions -- put, move, edit, remove -- the neighbourhood and
the path asked as instructions on the turn, and `EntityEdit`, which picks the instruction
from what changed. An entity acts on another by an edit, an attribute
at a time. The sheep, written on them again, is a third shorter and
does what it did.

### Grass looked for as far as a sheep reaches

A hungry sheep with no grass in the 16x16 cells about it used to
wander. Now the search widens (`Turn::seek`): the same 16x16
search over tiles of cells, to 64 cells a side -- 1,024 across, the
reach of any entity -- and it steps towards the nearest tile with
grass in it. It still takes one step a wake and keeps no route; a sheep
walks 170 to 220 steps before it starves, so the far end of its reach
it sees but never comes to.

The flock is what it was (`tilesim server pasture 2000000 333 4000 4 3`):
the same boom, crash and settling, to 10,319 sheep on 19% grass where
it was 10,897 on 21% -- fewer starve in the trough, so the grass is
kept a little shorter.

### What the renderer's time goes to

Profiled as it ran (`perf record -p`, 64 superchunks, flat out): the
simulation's threads are 90 to 95% of it, painting and the window the
rest; the ticks a second follow the flock -- 5,500 at 300,000 sheep,
2,400 at 715,000, 10,900 under 140,000. What a wake costs is waiting
for memory, not computing: so woken entities are now asked for ahead
(`simulation/docs/simulation.md`, "Woken entities are asked of memory
ahead"), a quarter off a wake.

### Saves (built)

A world is saved as a folder, and the folder's name is the world's:
nothing inside names it, so a world is renamed by renaming its folder.
A name given is made one any system takes as a folder's -- letters,
digits, spaces, `-`, `_` and `.` kept, the rest dropped
(`utilities::settings::world_name`). In it a world file, `world.csv` --
seed, tick, layer types, the world's size if it has one, and every
number it is generated by, so it goes on being made as it was begun
whatever the defaults come to be -- and two files a superchunk, named
by its 44-bit Morton index: its image, and its state -- its random
numbers, its entities.
A world loaded goes on exactly as the one saved would have, which is
why each superchunk's random numbers are now its own and kept from
tick to tick, not made anew from a tick's seed. The whole of it:
`server/docs/server.md`.

The code is where its parts are: the files in `chunk_storage::disk`,
the entities' words in `simulation`, where worlds are kept on a
machine in `utilities::settings`, and the save itself, which needs
them all, in `server/`. The `tilesim` crate is the program alone.

### Terrain and walls (built)

Every cell has a height, from the world's seed and where the cell is
(`worldgen/`): islands in an ocean, their land a mesh of vertices that
carry heights and lines that say how they are blended, in whole numbers
alone -- the same on any machine and in whatever order it is made,
seamless from superchunk to superchunk. Two cells beside one another
-- across or down -- more than one apart in height have a wall between
them: no step is taken through it. A diagonal step is open only when
both ways round it are. The walls are two layers of bits, so rules read
them as masks and never read a height; the pathfinding goes round
them, and the sheep step through none. Walls stand in cliffs, where
the ground is steep. The whole of it:
`worldgen/docs/worldgen.md`.

### Pathfinding (built, first form)

`pathfinding/`: over an area of 16x16 cells about a walker, held as
masks, a row a `u16`. A walker takes one pathfinding step each time it
ticks and keeps no route: a route goes stale and has to be held; a
step asked afresh is right about the world as the tick found it. A
step is found by waves: every goal's front moved a cell at once, each
row a few shifts and ors, the whole search's memory one line of cache;
the walker steps into the first wave to come beside it. A* is there
too, for one place to go. An entity's turn reads the area
(`instructions::area::read`), and the rule makes the masks: for a sheep,
grass the goals, the bitplanes held what may be walked on -- but for
the cells other entities stand on, which are in its way.

### Sampling rarely, and count tiles

Slowing grass a hundredfold made each sample dear: with a chosen cell
every 33,000 set cells and not every 330, sampling counted the bits of
hundreds of words to reach each one -- 10,000 instructions a sample
against 300 -- and so read most of every bitmap every tick, for a
handful of cells. The arena since keeps a count for every count tile
of 64 words of a bitmap, 16 a bitmap, 32 bytes beside its 8 KiB, in
step with every change; sampling passes over count tiles by them, and
counts the bits of one count tile's words at most (now 16 words: see
`performance.md`).

Measured (`tilesim server throughput`, grass at 0.003%, the same samples
before and after), sampling alone, one thread, by the processor's
counters:

| superchunks | instructions a sample, before | after | cycles a sample, before | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10,100 | 1,160 | 2,611 | 439 |
| 16 | 9,820 | 890 | 2,712 | 466 |
| 64 | 9,870 | 890 | 3,101 | 635 |
| 256 | 10,040 | 1,060 | 3,991 | 1,027 |

and the grass tick on 12 threads, ticks a second: 16 superchunks 10,564
to 26,551; 64, 5,395 to 16,342; 256, 1,469 to 3,793.

The instructions are the same at every size; the cycles are not, and
what is over is waiting on memory -- a third of sampling's time at 256
superchunks before, more than half after: fewer words are read, but
each is a jump the processor cannot fetch ahead of, where the scan was
a walk it could. (Load latencies sampled directly would say so
outright; they need the kernel's `perf_event_paranoid` lowered, which
was left as it is.) The threads are worth little while a tick is small:
at 16 superchunks a tick is 40 microseconds, about what handing it to
12 threads and back costs.

### Halos (built, first test)

The world is hot only about the entities that matter: each keeps its
superchunk and the eight about it hot -- its halo, as far as anything
reaches in a tick -- and every other superchunk is cold, its cells in
its image and its entities and random numbers kept as a save keeps
them. After every tick the halos move to where their hot entities came to,
nothing slow done on the tick: superchunks left go cold at once, their
changes encoded by a job and flushed by the ring in its own
time; superchunks reached are warming for 256 ticks -- decoded from
storage by a job, or generated if never made -- and turn hot
at that tick, not when the job is done, so the world is the
same however fast it is. Until then writes to them are missed and
entities sent there stay put. A world has no size unless given one: it
is made as it is reached, or, of a size, is a square of superchunks
about the origin, nothing past it ever hot. People will keep halos;
for now the sheep do -- the hot entity, which the server names -- and
the world starts as its origin superchunk, a flock on it, and the
flock's halo. With no hot entity nothing moves the halos: what is hot
is what was forced so. For this test only, grass is ticked only within three
superchunks across of the origin's middle, so its spreading cannot
grow the world without end. All of it is the simulation's -- what is
wanted hot, the warming and the cooling, counted in ticks -- and the
server lends it the world and what generates a superchunk never made:
`simulation/docs/simulation.md`, "Halos".

## Simulation (the plan)

From the concept notes:

- Structures and entities are held separately.
- A cell may hold one or more things, and one object may span many
  cells.
- Terrain generation is procedural, but adapts to changes in chunks
  already generated.
- The game is tick based. Events each tick are scheduled apart from
  scheduled updates, which go in a timer wheel (as Linux schedules its
  timers).
- Scheduled ticks are filtered by superchunk, then chunk, then cell,
  where possible, so they can run in parallel.
- Entity processing must be embarrassingly parallel, as must most cell
  tick processes.
- An entity always has a cell position in the world; an entity can span
  many cells, and under the right conditions many entities can share a
  cell.
