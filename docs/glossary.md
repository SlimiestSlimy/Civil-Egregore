# TileSim's glossary

Every word the code and the docs use for a thing of TileSim's own: what
it means, and what it relates to. One word is one thing, everywhere --
in type names, function names, variables, comments and docs. A word
listed here is never used for anything else, and a thing listed here is
never called anything else; the "not" column names the words a thing
is not called, so they stand out where they slip in.

Ordinary English and Rust words (`len`, `new`, `iter`, "count") mean
what they always do and are not listed.

## The world

| word | means | relates to | not |
|---|---|---|---|
| **world** | everything simulated: every superchunk, its layers and its entities, and the tick it is at | made from a **seed**; saved as a **save** | map |
| **seed** | the number a world is made from: every height, every superchunk's random numbers and every first flock follow from it | world, random stream | |
| **cell** | the smallest unit of the world: one bit of each layer, one height, at most one entity | chunk, superchunk; found by its **cell index** | tile, pixel, square |
| **chunk** | 256x256 cells: what a layer's **bitmap** covers | superchunk, layer, bucket | |
| **superchunk** | 4x4 chunks, 1024x1024 cells: the unit the world is held, ticked, saved and loaded in, and the reach of the speed of light. One word, in types too (`Superchunk`) | chunk, turn, image | super chunk, `SuperChunk` |
| **Morton index** | a number made by interleaving `x`'s and `y`'s bits, `x` in the even ones: cells, chunks and superchunks are numbered and stored in this order. The default way to say where anything is | Morton order | `morton` alone |
| **superchunk index** | a superchunk's Morton index in the world, 44 bits: what identifies a superchunk (`SuperchunkIndex`) | chunk index | position, `morton` alone |
| **chunk index** | a chunk's Morton index in the world, 48 bits: its superchunk index, then its place (`ChunkIndex`) | superchunk index, cell index | position |
| **cell index** | a cell's Morton index in the world, 64 bits: its chunk index, then its place (`CellIndex`) | chunk index, cartesian | address |
| **place** | a Morton index inside the thing around it, as a `usize`: a chunk's in its superchunk (0 to 15), a cell's in its chunk (0 to 65,535), or a cell's in its superchunk (20 bits, `CellIndex::place_in_superchunk`) | chunk index, cell index | slot, offset, position |
| **cartesian** | `x` and `y`, counted from the world's or a superchunk's top left; only for geometry and drawing, and always named so: `CartesianCell`, `from_cartesian`, `cartesian()`, `place_from_cartesian` | Morton index | world cell, coordinates (alone) |
| **Morton order** | the order of Morton indices: work is done and written in it, so memory is read forwards | sampling, wake | |
| **height** | a cell's height, 0 to 255, from the seed alone (`terrain::height`) | wall, height map | elevation |
| **wall** | a bar between two cells across or down more than one apart in height; kept by the upper or left cell, in the layers `WALL_EAST` and `WALL_SOUTH`. A diagonal step has no wall of its own: it is open only when both ways round it are | step, terrain | cliff (the viewer's drawing of walls) |
| **terrain** | a superchunk's heights and walls | height, wall | |

## Layers and bitmaps

| word | means | relates to | not |
|---|---|---|---|
| **layer type** | what a layer holds -- dirt, grass, a wall -- as a `u64` from the one namespace every type in TileSim is drawn from (`LayerType`) | entity type, attribute type | |
| **layer** | one layer type over one chunk: a bitmap of which cells hold it | bitmap, bitplane | plane |
| **bitplane** | one layer type over the whole world: every chunk's layer of that type | layer | |
| **bitmap** | 256x256 bits in Morton order, a word a 8x8 tile (`bitmap::Bitmap`, `CellWords`) | layer, tile | |
| **word** | 64 bits of a bitmap: an 8x8 tile of cells in Morton order | tile, window | |
| **word tile** | the 8x8 tile of cells one word holds; a word tile's index in its chunk is its word's index in the bitmap | word, window | |
| **tile** | an aligned square of cells whose side is a power of two. In a bitmap, an 8x8 tile is one word, a **word tile**; Tessera's tiles are its tree's squares, by **level**; the sampler counts the cells of 32x32 tiles; the far search looks over tiles by **scale** | window, word, level, scale | block, square |
| **scale** | a tile's side as a power of two, 0 one cell: the far search's tiles | tile | level (Tessera's, the other way round) |
| **window** | up to 8x8 cells at any cell, read out of the up to four words they overlap into one `u64`, row by row: bit `8y + x`. What rules read cells by (`Reader::window`) | around, area, tile | tile |
| **around** | the 3x3 cells about a cell, nine bits, row by row: bit `3y + x`, the cell itself bit 4 (`Around`) | window, area | neighbourhood |
| **area** | the 16x16 cells about a cell, a `u16` row each (`Area`, `Rows`): what an entity sees at once, and what paths are found over | around, window, pathfinding | |
| **mask** | bits standing for cells, any shape: a window, an around, an area's rows | | |
| **hot** | a layer decoded in the bitmap arena, read and written; a superchunk is hot when its layers are. The simulation ticks the hot superchunks only | cold, arena | held, loaded |
| **cold** | a layer kept encoded in chunk storage, not readable cell by cell | hot, image | |
| **dirty** | a hot layer changed since it was decoded: it must be written back before it is evicted | write back | |

| **cold pool** | chunk storage's superchunk images, one per superchunk stored. Never "pool" alone | image, block pool | |
| **image** | one superchunk as stored, one run of words, in memory as on disk: its height map and every chunk's encoded layers (`SuperchunkImage`) | chunk storage, save | |
| **height map** | a superchunk's heights, raw, a byte a cell (`HeightMap`) | height | |
| **layer codec** | encodes a layer for an image, and decodes it back, by Tessera (`LayerCodec`) | Tessera | |
| **encoded layer** | a layer's bitmap as Tessera encodes it: what images and the writeback ring hold | layer codec, image | bitmap (a bitmap is decoded) |

| **evict** | drop a hot layer from the arena; a dirty one must be written back first | hot | |
| **bitmap arena** | the hot side: every hot layer, in allocations a superchunk and a layer type each (`BitmapArena`) | allocation, bucket, directory | |
| **allocation** | one layer type over one superchunk in the arena: one block of the block pool, a bucket a chunk | block, bucket | |
| **bucket** | one chunk's hot layer: its words in its allocation, and its counts | layer, allocation | |
| **directory** | the arena's list of hot superchunks, sorted by superchunk index, each with its allocations by layer type | lookup | |
| **lookup** | finding a layer in the directory; a reader remembers its last sixteen | reader, directory | |
| **block** | an equal-size piece of memory from the allocator's block pool, owned by whoever holds it (`allocator::Block`) | block pool, allocation | (for anything that is not memory) |
| **block pool** | the allocator's blocks, made, handed out, taken back (`BlockPool`). Never "pool" alone | block | |
| **save** | a world on disk: a folder of a world file and every superchunk's image and state, named by superchunk index | image, world | directory (the arena's list) |
| **folder** | a folder of the file system: a save, or where measurements are kept | save | directory |

| **turn** | one superchunk's part of the first phase: what a rule is given (`Turn`) | rule, superchunk | |
| **rule** | what decides what changes: a Monte Carlo rule of the cells (`mc_rules`), or an entity's rule (`entity_rules`) | turn, sampling | |
| **speed of light** | 1,024 cells a tick: nothing reaches past the superchunks next to its own; an entity is at most 256x256 cells | outbox, reach | |

| **sleep** | an entity waiting, doing nothing and costing nothing, until it wakes | wake | |
| **wheel** | a superchunk's timer wheel: a slot a tick for the next 1,024, the wakes due in each (`Wheel`); it **passes** a tick once the tick is run | wake | turn |
| **instruction** | a change to an entity, queued in the first phase and applied in the second: put, move, edit, remove (`Instruction`, `Instructions`) | outbox, apply | command, change |
