//! Cells into pixels, on a thread of its own: between the simulation,
//! which only copies the cells in view, and the window, which only
//! shows pixels. So drawing takes no time from the ticks, however much
//! of the world is in view, and none from the window's frames.
//!
//! A cell is a pixel in one solid colour: dirt brown, grass green, a
//! sheep white. From far off, where
//! a pixel is many cells, it is their colours mixed: a tile of cells
//! `2^detail` a side is, in Morton order, a run of bits, so the grass
//! in it is counted from the words without a cell looked at.
