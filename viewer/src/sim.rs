//! The simulation's side: a pasture ticked on a thread of its own, which
//! the window asks -- never the other way round -- for the cells in
//! view.
//!
//! The window sends [`Request`]s; the simulation reads them between
//! ticks, and answers each [`Request::Sync`] with a [`Frame`]: the
//! superchunks in view as the last tick left them -- their grass's
//! words, copied as they are, and where their sheep stand. It copies and
//! nothing more: turning cells into pixels is [`crate::paint`]'s, on
//! another thread, so what is in view costs the ticks next to nothing
//! -- and a frame carries only so many superchunks, the window going
//! round those in view, so it costs no more however many there are.
//! It sends nothing unasked, so it is the window that sets how often
//! the world is drawn, and a window that falls behind slows no tick.
//!
//! It ticks until the window is closed, with no number of ticks to
//! stop at, and keeps a census of the flock and the grass as it goes
//! ([`census_path`]): what a long run came to is there once it is
//! closed.
