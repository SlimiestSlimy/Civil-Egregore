//! Sheep on the grass: TileSim's first entity. A sheep sleeps until it
//! next needs something, and wakes for that alone:
//!
//! - **Rests while satisfied**: fed, it sleeps where it stands until it
//!   is hungry again, [`MEAL_TICKS`] after its meal -- or until its lamb
//!   is due, or it is grown, if that is sooner. It does not wake to
//!   wander: a sheep with nothing to do costs nothing.
//! - **Eats**: hungry and on grass, it eats it, the cell back to dirt.
//!   Hungry and not, it walks, a step every [`STEP_TICKS`] ticks or so,
//!   and starves [`STARVE_TICKS`] after it grew hungry.
//! - **Breeds**: a grown sheep may fall pregnant on a meal taken on
//!   lush pasture -- [`LUSH_CELLS`] of the 16 by 16 cells
//!   about it grass -- at one in
//!   [`CONCEIVE_ONE_IN`]; [`GESTATION_TICKS`] on, a lamb is born on a
//!   free cell beside it, grown [`LAMB_TICKS`] after. So a flock on thin
//!   grass stops growing before it strips it.
//! - **Leaves thin pasture**: a meal taken where it is not lush, the
//!   sheep sets off when next hungry, [`ROAM_TICKS`] of steps one way,
//!   eating nothing on the way, and looks for grass where it comes to.
//!   Without it lambs stay beside their mothers, a flock grazes its own
//!   patch bare, and breeds no more though the world is green.
//! - **Dies**: of hunger, or of old age, [`LIFE_TICKS`] of sleep to a
//!   life on average, whatever it sleeps by.
//! - **Never stands where another does**: a step onto a cell an entity
//!   stands on is turned back as it is applied, and the sheep stays
//!   where it is -- it does not look first, few cells having one; a
//!   lamb is born on a cell seen free beside its mother, who waits for
//!   one; and a path to grass goes round the entities in the way.
//! - **Walks, hungry**: onto a neighbour with grass if there is one,
//!   else a step along the shortest path to the nearest grass in the
//!   16 by 16 cells about it (`pathfinding`'s
//!   waves) -- one pathfinding step a wake, no route kept; with no
//!   grass in reach, onto any neighbour. Never off the hot bitplanes.
//!
//! When it is next hungry, when its lamb is due and when it is grown
//! are attributes, each a tick, and the way it roams another: all but
//! the first added and removed at run time, as attributes are meant to
//! be. They are ticks, not counts of
//! wakes, because a sheep's wakes are as far apart as its needs.
//!
//! What is the sheep's own is here, and only that: the 3x3 cells about
//! it, the area, the path, the cell seen free, the instruction that
//! carries least are the simulation's (`simulation::around`,
//! `Turn`, `EntityEdit`), there for every entity.
//!
//! The rule runs in a tick's first phase, as grass does, reading the
//! world as the tick found it: two sheep may eat one cell in a tick,
//! which then changes once.
