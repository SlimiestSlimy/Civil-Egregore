# The entities, function by function

The design is in `entity_rules.md`.

## `sheep.rs`

`SHEEP`, and its attributes `HUNGRY_AT`, `PREGNANT`, `LAMB`, each a
tick, and `ROAMING`, the tick it roams until and which way;
`STEP_TICKS` (64) and `STEP_JITTER` (16) between a walking sheep's
steps, `MEAL_TICKS` (6,912), `STARVE_TICKS` (13,824),
`LUSH_CELLS` (64, of the area's 256), `CONCEIVE_ONE_IN` (5),
`ROAM_TICKS` (3,456), `LIFE_TICKS` (172,800),
`GESTATION_TICKS` (1,152), `LAMB_TICKS` (4,608).

**`rule(turn)`**: hands **`wake`**, the rule for one sheep, to `read::entities::each_woken`, with a **`Flock`** (the counts, and room for attributes). Every sheep waking on the superchunk's turn sees to
what it woke for and sleeps as long as it can. Hungry (past
`HUNGRY_AT`) and on grass, it eats it, and is hungry again `MEAL_TICKS`
on; hungry `STARVE_TICKS` with no meal, it dies. Its lamb due, it is
born on a cell seen free beside it (`read::around::free_beside`),
or waited for; it falls pregnant on a meal on lush pasture
(`LUSH_CELLS` of the area about it grass, `Area::count`; one in
`CONCEIVE_ONE_IN`) if grown; a meal on pasture not lush, it is `ROAMING`
-- when next hungry it walks one way for `ROAM_TICKS`, eating nothing,
before it looks for grass; a lamb past its tick is grown. Satisfied,
it stays where it stands and wakes at the first of those ticks to come;
hungry, it walks -- onto a grass neighbour, else a step to the nearest
grass no entity stands on in the area about it, round the entities in
the way, and with none there to the nearest further off, as far as it
reaches (`Turn::seek`, one step a wake), else
onto any hot neighbour (`around::pick`), without looking whether an
entity stands there: the step is turned back if one does -- and wakes a
step's time on (**`next_step`**). What it came to is queued by
`write::entities::commit`: a move, unless an attribute changed. Before a
sleep it dies of old age at the sleep's ticks in `LIFE_TICKS`. Returns
its `RuleCounts`, their places named **`WOKEN`**, **`EATEN`**,
**`BIRTHS`**, **`DEATHS`**, **`SOUGHT`**, **`PATHS`**, **`FAR`** -- paths
looked for, found, and found beyond the area -- and their names listed
in **`COUNTED`**.

**`tick(simulation, arena, entities, seed)`**: one tick of the sheep
alone, the cells changing only as they change them.

**`flock(entities, superchunk, count, random)`**: grown sheep, each
some way from its next meal, queued each on a cell of its own drawn at
random, waking
over the next `STEP_TICKS` ticks.
