//!
//! | under `transient_data/` | what it holds | written by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `seed` | the seed corpus bitmaps grow from, and how many runs have used it | every run that grows a corpus ([`crate::corpus::seed`]) |
//! | `measurements/` | every measuring tool's latest tables, as CSV, with what they were measured on | the diagnostics tools, the searches and the external benchmarks, through [`publish`] |
//! | `worst/` | the worst bitmap each adversarial search has found so far, as PBM | the adversarial searches ([`crate::diagnostics::adversarial::worst`]) |
//! | `renders/` | PNG images of the bitmaps looked at | `diagnostics render` |
//! | `callgrind/` | each instruction count's callgrind output, to see where the instructions go | `diagnostics instruction_count` |
//!
//! Every path is relative to the crate's folder, found from it wherever
//! a run starts from.

//! Function by function: `docs/lab.md`, "`transient_data.rs`".
