//! TileSim's allocator: a block pool of equal-size blocks of words, handed out
//! and taken back, for structures that must never move once made -- a
//! block stays where it is from its allocation on, so nothing in it is
//! ever copied to make room. It is for chunk storage and the bitplane
//! manager, and nothing else (`../docs/tilesim.md`, "Memory"); nothing
//! uses it now, the arena's buckets being a variable array.
//!
//! A block is an owning handle: its holder has its words, and gives it
//! back to the block pool when done. A new block is asked of the system
//! zeroed, so its pages cost nothing until first written. A released
//! block is kept, not freed, and handed out again before any new one is
//! made: holding whatever it held, which its next user overwrites.
//!
//! This is the allocator's first form. `../docs/tilesim.md` plans its
//! next: per area, in 256 MiB system blocks cut into 256-byte units,
//! with owning handles freed on drop.

//! The design: `docs/allocator.md`; function by function:
//! `docs/reference.md`.

// Every item is documented, private ones included; `cargo clippy`
// checks the private ones.
#![warn(missing_docs, clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items)]
