//! Monte Carlo sampling of the hot bitplanes (`../bitplane_manager`): every set cell of a layer
//! type chosen with one probability, independently, and handed out in
//! Morton order -- superchunk by superchunk, chunk by chunk, cell by
//! cell -- so what is computed from the samples, and the writes it
//! queues, come in that order already, never sorted.
//!
//! No sample is wasted: the cells are not each tossed a coin, nor drawn
//! and rejected. The set cells are ranked in Morton order, and the gap
//! from one chosen rank to the next is drawn from the geometric law
//! (`docs/tilesim.md`, "Sampling"): each set cell is then chosen with
//! the probability asked, and only the chosen ones are found. The
//! counts find them: a layer type over a superchunk with no hot cell
//! set is passed over whole, a chunk by its count, a count tile of 16 words by
//! its count, a word by its bits' count, and only the word holding a chosen
//! cell is searched. So a sample costs the same few counts however far
//! from the last it is: the rarer the samples, the less of a bitmap is
//! read at all.
