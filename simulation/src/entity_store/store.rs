//! Where entities are kept: a superchunk's in a bucket a chunk, with
//! its timer wheel ([`SuperchunkEntities`]), and every superchunk's, in
//! the bitmap arena's order, with the tick the world is at
//! ([`Entities`]) -- read in a tick across superchunks by an
//! [`EntityReader`], as cells are by the bitplanes' reader.
//!
//! The API follows the bitplanes': outside a tick, instructions are
//! queued ([`Entities::queue_put`], [`Entities::queue_remove`]) and
//! applied ([`Entities::apply`]), as writes to cells are; in a tick, a
//! superchunk's turn queues them. Queuing is the only way to change an
