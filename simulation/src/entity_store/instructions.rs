//! Instructions: changes to entities, queued in a tick's first phase and
//! applied in its second by the superchunk they land in -- as writes are
//! to the bitplanes. There is an instruction for each thing a rule does to an
//! entity, so each carries, and costs, no more than it changes:
//!
//! | instruction | what it does | what it carries |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | put | an entity made, or made anew whole: header and attributes | its attributes |
//! | move | an entity moved to another cell, or left where it is, to wake at another tick; its attributes as they are | nothing |
//! | edit | one attribute of an entity set, or removed: by the entity itself or by another | the one value |
//! | remove | an entity removed | nothing |
//!
//! Whatever puts an entity on a cell checks it as it is applied: a cell
//! holds one entity, ever. An instruction carries all it needs: an entity moving to a
//! neighbour goes as a whole copy, made in the first phase from the
//! world as the tick found it, so the second never reads another
//! superchunk's entities while that one changes them.
