//! A chunk's entities: their headers, sorted by cell in Morton order,
//! and their attributes, kept together in one list beside them.
//!
//! **A cell holds at most one entity.** An entity put on a cell another
//! entity stands on is not put; one moving onto it stays where it was.
//! This file is where that rule is enforced, whatever a rule asks for.
//!
//! An entity is found by its cell and its ID. Its cell's place in the
//! chunk (16 bits) is searched for in a list holding only the places,
//! two bytes per entity, which stays in the caches; the headers are not
//! read until the place is found. Entities woken in Morton order are
//! therefore found by walking forwards through the bucket, the same way
//! cells sampled in Morton order are read forwards through a bitmap. An
//! entity stepping to another cell of the same chunk shifts the entities
//! between its old and new cell by one.
//!
//! Each entity's attributes are a run of the attribute list. They are
//! rewritten in place when their number stays the same. When the number
//! changes (an attribute added or removed, which is rare), the new run
//! goes at the end of the list and the old run becomes garbage, which is
//! swept out once there is as much garbage as attributes in use.
