//! The tick, superchunk by superchunk, in two phases, on the
//! dispatcher's threads (`../../docs/tilesim.md`, "The tick").
//!
//! 1. **Computing**: every superchunk runs the rule on itself -- samples
//!    its own cells, reads any cell in reach, and queues writes. Nothing
//!    changes in this phase, so every superchunk reads the world as the
//!    tick found it, and the threads share the arena read-only. A write
//!    is queued in its superchunk's outbox: nine queues, by where it
//!    lands -- the superchunk itself or one of its eight neighbours,
//!    never farther, the speed of light being a superchunk's side.
//! 2. **Applying**: every superchunk applies the writes queued for it --
//!    from its own outbox and its eight neighbours', in a fixed order --
//!    to its own bitmaps only. The threads share the outboxes
//!    read-only, and each changes only the superchunks it holds.
//!
//! Entities tick in the same two phases: in the first, the entities
//! waking in a superchunk run the rule with its cells, reading the world
//! as the tick found it, and queue instructions -- an entity put, moved,
//! edited or removed -- in the outbox slot of the superchunk each lands
//! in; in the second, each superchunk applies the instructions queued
//! for it, beside its writes. An entity moving to a
//! neighbour goes as a whole copy, made in the first phase.
//!
//! The threads hold contiguous runs of the superchunks, so each works
//! through them in Morton order, and the outboxes need no
//! synchronization: in the first phase each is written by its own
//! superchunk alone, in the second only read. Each superchunk has random
//! numbers of its own, kept from tick to tick, so a tick comes out the
//! same on any number of threads.
