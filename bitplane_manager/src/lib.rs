//! TileSim's bitplane manager: the bitmap arena, the hot bitmaps, raw,
//! one a bucket -- the layers whose cells are being read or changed,
//! decoded from chunk storage's cold pool and nothing more. It is where
//! cells are read and changed: chunk storage holds whole encoded layers
//! only.
//!
//! The arena is made of allocations, each a block of the allocator's
//! block pool (`../allocator`) holding one layer type over one
//! superchunk: a bucket for each of its 16 chunks, in the chunks' Morton
//! order ([`ChunkPlace::index`]). A chunk's bucket is found in its
//! allocation by that index, with no search, and a bucket never moves:
//! making a bitmap hot or cold moves no other.
//!
//! Which allocation holds which layer type over which superchunk is a
//! small directory: the superchunks in use, sorted by superchunk index,
//! and for each its allocations, sorted by layer type -- the one thing
//! ever sorted, and it holds no bitmaps. The last 16 lookups are
//! remembered, so the runs of lookups in a few superchunks and types
//! that Morton-ordered work makes search nothing. The allocations lie
//! wherever they were made; each is one run of memory in Morton order.
//!
//! The arena grows an allocation at a time, as a layer type turns hot
//! over a superchunk it had none of. An allocation none of whose chunks
//! is hot or waiting in the ring (below) leaves the directory, and its
//! block goes back to the block pool, which hands it out next.
//!
//! Cells are changed by writes, batched (`writes`): queued, then applied
//! in order. Each superchunk ([`Superchunk`]) owns its blocks, so
//! superchunks are read and changed apart: the simulation
//! (`../simulation`) samples and reads them on as many threads as it
//! likes ([`LayerView`], [`Reader`]), and applies writes to each
//! ([`Superchunk::apply`]).
//!
//! A bucket changed since it was decoded is dirty, and
//! [`BitmapArena::write_back`] encodes it into chunk storage's writeback
//! ring (`../chunk_storage`) -- no words where no cell is set, since a
//! type with no cell set has no layer. A dirty bucket must be written
//! back before it is evicted. The ring is never read to make a bitmap
//! hot, so a bucket written back stays in its allocation, evicted or
//! not, until chunk storage flushes its superchunk into the cold pool:
//! a bitmap evicted and made hot again before then is the bucket as it
//! was, not decoded.

//! The design: `docs/bitplane_manager.md`; function by function:
//! `docs/reference.md`.

// Every item is documented, private ones included; `cargo clippy`
// checks the private ones.
