//! Chunk storage: the cold pool of superchunk images and the writeback
//! ring that feeds it (`../docs/tilesim.md`, "Chunk storage").
//!
//! The bitplane manager decodes layers from the cold pool, and writes
//! the ones it changed back into the ring, encoded. The ring is never
//! read to make a layer hot: a layer with an entry in the ring is still
//! hot in the bitmap arena. When the ring is full, the superchunk at its
//! tail is flushed: its image rewritten once with all its entries, and
//! those entries freed. The bitmap arena is told which superchunks were
//! flushed, since only then may it drop their evicted layers.
