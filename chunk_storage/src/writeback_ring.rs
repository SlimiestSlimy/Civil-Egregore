//! The writeback ring: changed layers, encoded, on their way to the
//! cold pool -- a sponge for writes, so a superchunk's image is rewritten
//! once for many of its layers rather than once per layer.
//!
//! A ring buffer of words. An entry is a header -- its chunk's Morton
//! index in the world, its layer type, its length and whether it is
//! dead -- then the encoded layer's words; an entry of no words says the
//! layer is gone. Entries never wrap: one that does not fit before the end
//! starts again at the start, a marker left where it would have gone.
//! Entries are written at the head and freed from the tail: releasing a
//! superchunk marks its entries dead, and the tail moves past dead
//! entries.
//!
//! The ring grows only when empty and still too small for an entry:
//! otherwise, when an entry does not fit, chunk storage rewrites the
//! superchunk at the tail ([`WritebackRing::tail_superchunk`]) until it
//! does.
