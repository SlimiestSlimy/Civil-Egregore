//! What a layer is, and how its bitmap is encoded and decoded.
//!
//! A layer is a pair of a [`LayerType`] -- what it represents, from
//! specific things to properties -- and a bitmap marking the cells where
//! it holds, Tessera-encoded in 64-bit words. A Tessera stream ends
//! itself, so an encoded bitmap's exact length is never kept: decoding
//! reads from its first word, whatever follows its last.
//!
//! [`LayerCodec`] holds what encoding and decoding need, allocated once:
//! a Tessera, its stream, and the bitmap it decodes into. Encoding reads
//! a bitmap's cells from wherever they are held -- an arena's bucket,
//! say -- and decoding writes them there.
