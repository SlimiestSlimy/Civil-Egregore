//! A superchunk's heights: one [`Height`] a cell, held raw, 8 to a
//! word -- the words a superchunk image holds them in.
//!
//! The heights are laid out in Morton order over the whole superchunk:
//! chunk by chunk in their Morton order, and in each chunk in the Morton
//! order its bitmaps use (`bitmap::morton`). So each chunk's heights
//! are one run, and any aligned square of cells is one run of heights,
//! as it is one run of bits in a layer.
