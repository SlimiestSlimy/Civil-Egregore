//! Civil Egregore's bitmap: 256 by 256 cells, and everything that can be asked
//! of them or done to them. Every layer of a chunk is one; Tessera
//! (`../tessera/`) encodes them.
//!
//! | file | what is in it |
//! |---|---|
//! | `bitmap_data` | what a bitmap is, its Morton-order layout, and what can be asked of a cell or a tile |
//! | `bitmap_drawing` | rectangles and circles, drawn by their shape |
//! | [`morton`] | the Morton order the cells are laid out in, which any structure over the same cells can share |
//! | [`window`] | windows: up to 8x8 cells at any cell, cut from the word tiles they overlap, each turned from Morton order into rows |
//! | `diagnostics/` | data gathered, to be measured and tested on: none yet |
//! | `transient_data` | the crate's `transient_data/`, out of git: what its runs leave behind |
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything. What to describe, at what size, in
//! what order, is for whatever reads the bitmap.

//! The design: `docs/bitmap.md`; function by function:
//! `docs/reference.md`.

// Every item is documented, private ones included; `cargo clippy`
// checks the private ones.
#![warn(missing_docs, clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items)]
