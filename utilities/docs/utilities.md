# Utilities

General-purpose utilities, shared by every crate in Civil Egregore and owned by
none.

- **Diagnostics** (`src/diagnostics/`), what every crate's diagnostics
  are made with:
  - **tables and reports** (`table/`): the one table printer; a
    measurement's report -- its tables, notes, and the command and
    commit it came from -- printed and kept as CSV in a folder the
    caller names (each crate's `transient_data/measurements/`), and
    read back;
  - **the process's memory** (`process_memory.rs`), as the system
    counts it: held now and at its peak, from `/proc/self/status`
    (Linux only), and tracked over a run for the average.
- **Transient data** (`transient_data.rs`): where a crate's runs leave
  what they make, `transient_data/` beside its `Cargo.toml`, out of git.
  Each crate names its own in its `src/transient_data.rs`.
- **Commands** (`commands.rs`): a command line's first word found among
  a crate's commands and handed the rest. A crate's tools are functions
  listed with their parameters, each declared once with its default;
  the one program routes to a crate by name and knows none of its tools.
- **Settings** (`settings.rs`): this machine's settings, kept from run
  to run in one file in one folder of Civil Egregore's own, wherever the
  system keeps such, a line each, shared by whatever has settings (so
  far the renderer's sliders), found by name in any order -- what the
  file lacks is the default settings'. The default settings are such a file
  built into the program: copied to a machine that has none, never
  over one that has, and all there is under the build feature
  `force_default_settings`. The same folder holds the worlds, in `worlds`,
  unless the settings name another folder for them.
- **What is tuned by eye** (`tuning.rs`): the numbers a window's
  sliders set -- the near view's shading, read each frame, and how a
  new world is made, read once when one is -- by name and place: a
  value handed about, nothing of it held in a static. What a slider
  reaches, its group and what it does are in the sliders' file
  (`sliders.csv`, at the crate's root), written by hand; what each is
  unless set is in the default settings.
- **The seed** (`seed.rs`): the one seed every crate's tests and tools
  start from, in the workspace's `transient_data/seed.csv`, rolled every 5
  counted runs; `CIVIL_EGREGORE_SEED` picks one for a run.
- **A seeded random source** (`rng.rs`), its whole state one word: every
  random number in Civil Egregore comes from it.
- **Hashing** (`hash.rs`): a key's slot in a table, by
  Fibonacci hashing, and a word's bits mixed, SplitMix64's way.
- **A fixed-capacity list** (`fixed_list.rs`), allocated once, never
  growing: for structures sized once and reused.
- **The cache** (`cache.rs`): memory asked for ahead of its being read.

## Layout

| folder | what is in it |
|---|---|
| `src/` | the utilities above |
| `src/diagnostics/` | tables, reports, the process's memory |
| `tests/` | each, judged |
| `docs/` | this, and the reference, function by function |
| `transient_data/` | out of git: what its tests keep |
